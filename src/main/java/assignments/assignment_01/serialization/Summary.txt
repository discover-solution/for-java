Key differences between Serializable and Externalizable 

Implementation  : 
                Unlike Serializable interface which will serialize the variables in object with just by implementing interface,
                Here we have to explicitly mention what fields or variables you want to serialize.

Methods : 
                Serializable is marker interface without any methods. 
                Externalizable interface contains two methods: 
                    --> writeExternal() and readExternal().

Process: 
                Default Serialization process will take place for classes implementing Serializable interface.
                Programmer defined Serialization process for classes implementing Externalizable interface.

Backward Compatibility and Control:
                If you have to support multiple versions, you can have full control with Externalizable interface.
                You can support different versions of your object.
                If you implement Externalizable, itâ€™s your responsibility to serialize super class.

public No-arg constructor:
                Serializable uses reflection to construct object and does not require no arg constructor.
                But Externalizable requires public no-arg constructor.
